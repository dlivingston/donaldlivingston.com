Been Kicking around with a few design tweaks here and there on the website, while also testing a few things in the Sandbox. Also testing how well LiveReload works with Jekyll.

I need to practise my writing so I can get a better at it. I know the reasons why. I need to spend more time organizing my thoughts and clarifiying myslef than the occational tweet or facebook post.

I haven't really kept any records as to the number of times I’ve redesigned, rebuilt, recoded, or otherwise modified my personal website since it first went live. So it would be a futile exercise to attempt to label it with a version number. Suffice it to say that I’ve been spending some time cultivating my corner of the internet garden, and here it is. After trying to wrangle a new Wordpress theme into submission for several months with several unsatisfying results, the Jekyll platform came across my radar and I decided to kick Wordpress to the curb. 

While I still have some further additions and updates to make, So far I’m fairly pleased with how things are shaping up.

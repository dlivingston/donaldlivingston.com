I have a very poor history of maintaining a blog with any regularity. Usually my blogging comes in short sprints after making a New Years Resolution, or during some personal event that inspired me to resume my attempts at writing. These blogging sprints have faltered because I have tended to write mostly about myself, and self-involved navel-gazing doesn’t make for very interesting writing.

So with that in mind I will shift my attention away from myself, and I will start making a regular blog on the topics of my chosen profession of Web Development, Web Design, and UX/UI Design. Initially most of my blog posts will either be inspired by or commentary on the news that I find on other blogs and web sites. I don’t really expect much of a readership to develop. This is mostly an exercise for my own professional and personal development.
